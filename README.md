# VASC
VASC is a free 3D-racing game developed using Unity Game Engine where the goal of the game is for the player to win racing tournaments. The entire game's functionality is built around the C# programming language, which is the technology utilized.

The game will generally center on road racing.Before each race, the player will choose a vehicle and an unlocked track of his/her choice. The number of obstacles and the opponents' pace within a level increase in difficulty as the player proceeds throughout the game. The player must win every level in order to fully complete the game, which features a number of racetracks of differing difficulties.

VASC will introduce a number of competitions with an economic focus that give participants cash prizes to use toward auto maintenance, upgrades, or purchases cars and unlocking the tracks for subsequent races.
